# SW Development Internship Project for Medo.AI

## Part 1: Simple Image Annotation Tool
- There are two solutions provided for this part (`medoai` and `medoailib`)
- `medoai` is an implementation without the use of any libraries
- `medoailib` is an implementation with the use of libraries
- `medoai` solution is provided along with `medoailib` in case there are issues installing npm packages in `medoalib`
- Instructions on how to install and run the two solutions are in [medoai/README.md](https://github.com/KumailHusain/medoai/blob/master/medoai/README.md) and [medoailib/README.md](https://github.com/KumailHusain/medoai/blob/master/medoailib/README.md)

## Part 2: Simple UI/UX testing test
- The sample scripts are located in the `samplescripts` directory


This technical test was completed by Kumail Husain (shusain@ualberta.ca) without any collaboration.
